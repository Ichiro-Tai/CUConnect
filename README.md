# CUConnect

https://devpost.com/software/cuconnect

Connecting the education around the Champaign-Urbana community.

## Guideline to run CUConnect

### Required installation: Flask and Node.js

On a single server, run both the Python Flask framework with main.py and Node.js with index.js.

`node index.js`

`export FLASK_APP=main.py`

`flask run`

Currently, this project is still hosted on the localhost, so the website can be accessed at 127.0.0.1:5000 with both backend systems running

This project is still in demo, so some features may not work as intended.
